# RegioSQM

Avaliable on [regioqm.org](http://regiosqm.org).

Predict Regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions in
heteroaromatic systems.
RegioSQM finds the aromatic CH group with the highest proton affinity estimated
by the PM3/COSMO method using the MOPAC program.
More information is available at the [RegioSQM paper](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7SC04156J).

# Installation

    - MOPAC (http://openmopac.net/)
    - RDKit (http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)
    - obabel (https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html)

RegioSQM depends on MOPAC for quantum calculations, OpenBabel for some
formation convertion and RDkit in the python enviroment for everything else.

# Usage

The workflow is as following

    cd example
	
    # generate conformations from SMILES
    python ../regiosqm/regiosqm.py -g ./example.smiles > ./example.csv
	
    # Run all .mop files with mopac
    # or submit them to a cluster

    ls *mop | parallel -j4 "mopac {}"
    
    "PowerShell"
    foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem -Filter "*mop") { mopac $file }
	
    # use the generated csv file to analyse all the 
    python ../regiosqm/regiosqm.py -a ./example.smiles ./example.csv > ./example_results.csv


The results are now parseable from the results file, or viewable by 2D structures with regioselective indicators (in svg format).
